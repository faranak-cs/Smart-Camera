# Smart-Camera
 A surveillance camera with live video streaming and picture capturing made using esp32-CAM. The camera can be accessed by anyone connected to the same network with an IP assigned to the camera.

Right now it is an optimized version of ESP32 CameraWebServer with some tweaks. I am planning to use it for Object Detection using OpenCV and some other python libraries. I will use the Camera IP in the python script to capture continuous frames and apply Object Detection.
